# 👋 Hey there, welcome!

Thanks for stopping by my GitHub!
Here you’ll find a mix of projects I’m building, experimenting with, and learning from.

## What i'm working on currently
### What i do and how I work with AI - Prompt Engineering and not "Vibe Coding"
The goal is for code to be designed well. Less need to be refactored by the mess that vibe coding brings in. I’ve been experimenting with this ALOT (6 months now) and it seems to do it quite well.

### Some key aspects:

Clarity → Writing prompts that are unambiguous and easy for the model to follow.

Context → Providing the right background, examples, or constraints so the model has enough information.

Structure → Breaking down tasks into steps or using formats like bullet points, instructions, or role-playing.

Iteration → Testing and tweaking prompts repeatedly to see which phrasing produces the best results.

Control → Using techniques like few-shot prompting (showing examples), chain-of-thought prompting (guiding reasoning), or system messages to shape outputs.

## 🚀 What you’ll see here

* 🌱 Projects where I explore new tech and ideas
* 💻 Web apps, APIs, and tools I’m tinkering with
* 📚 Notes, experiments, and code snippets that help me learn

## 🛠️ Tech I like working with

* Frontend: React, Tailwind, TypeScript
* Backend: C#, Node.js, Supabase, REST & GraphQL
* Tools: Next.js, Git, Vite, Figma, APIs and anything modern & fun

## 🤝 Let’s connect

I’m always open to learning, collaborating, or just chatting about code.
